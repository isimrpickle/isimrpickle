## ðŸ”­ Projects

### [ANNS algorithms that were based on a paper of ACM's Web Conference in 2023](https://github.com/KKalamari/Project)
Implemented two ANNS algorithms, FilteredVamana and StitchedVamana, and conducted thorough benchmarking to evaluate their performance and accuracy

- **Technologies**: C++, Unit Testing, Software Development
- **Key Skills**: Concurrency, Scripting, Organizing a multi-file project 

### [Priority-based Scheduler in XV6](https://github.com/isimrpickle/OS_assignment_2)
*Implemented a new priority-based scheduler for the XV6 operating system, making the necessary changes in the kernel to support priority levels for processes.*

- **Technologies**: C, XV6, Operating Systems
- **Key Skills**: System calls, kernel development

### [I/O Communication and Network Programming in C](https://github.com/isimrpickle/system_programming_1)
*Designed a robust system for inter-process communication using shared memory/ FIFOs/ sockets, and multi-threading.*

- **Technologies**: C, Linux, Sockets, Threads, Shared Memory
- **Key Skills**: Concurrency, Networking, I/O, IPC

### [Berkeley AI Project](https://github.com/isimrpickle/Berkeley-pac-man-project-1)
Completed a foundational project from the UC Berkeley AI course. The projects focus on fundamental AI concepts like search algorithms, and decision-making optimization. 

- **Technologies**: Python
- **Key Skills**: AI algorithms, Search algorithms

### [Web API in C#](https://github.com/isimrpickle/WebApi)
*Built a fully functional web API in C#*

- **Technologies**: C#, .NET Core, SQL
- **Key Skills**:  Web API, SQL


### [C++ ASCII game](https://github.com/isimrpickle/WvsV)
Built a simple ascii game in C++ demostrating the properties of object oriented programming. 

- **Technologies**: C++
- **Key skills**: Object-Oriented-prorgamming

### [Assembly Projects](https://github.com/isimrpickle/Optimized_Matrix_Multiplication/tree/main)
- In the context of Computer architecture I built 2 assembly projects, the first one was about reading some values form an array while also calculating some statistics about the array's values and the second one was about cache-friendly matrix multiplication. Both projects even though simple in code, were written to be fully optimized considering different CPU and cache architectures.

### [parallelization Focused Projects](https://github.com/isimrpickle/Parallel_Systems_Assignment1)

- Implemented some standard parallelization problems in various APIs such as openMP, MPI and Pthreads showcasing
the differences between those APIs as also its use cases.
